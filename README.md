File information:
The file project1.rkt contains the code for the project. devlog.md contains the notes I made before and after every session of working on the project. 

How to run the code:
To compile/run the code after downloading the zip containing all the files is to go to command line and type cd "file path" where file path is wherever you saved the file. For example in my case it would be cd C:\Users\Ayush Katwal\ayushkatwal-project1
Next to run the code in batch mode (no prompts) in command line type 'racket project1.rkt -b' and test with any inputs
To run the code in interactive mode where the user is prompted to input type 'racket project1.rkt' in command line

Input format notes:
Please note that each token is expected to be separated by a space in my code. For example to do 2+3, the user must input + 2 3 where a space separates each token.
